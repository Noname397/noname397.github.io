        <p>An abandoned limestone quarry is flooded over and takes on a magnificent, aquamarine hue. Named “Quarry Lake,” this body of water is the perfect, colourful escape on a hot summer day. Located on Texada Island, the swimming hole greets visitors with a breath-taking view.

            The Quarry is considered to be private property; however, the rest of the island promotes tourism and offers a plethora of beautiful places to explore.</p>
