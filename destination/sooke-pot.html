        <p>Located on the banks of the remarkable Sooke River featuring potholes unlike anything you've seen before is Sooke Potholes Regional Park. These rare geological formations, a series of deep, smooth rock pools, are a local hotspot featuring some of the best freshwater swimming around. The pools and potholes are crystal clear and refreshingly clean. Great for picnics, hikes and pool-hopping, the farther you go up the river, the better it gets.</p>
        <p>The Sooke River, which runs through the potholes, is the second largest river on the south island. Every fall, salmon return to the river to spawn; both the end and the beginning of a beautiful lifecycle. The amazing run of these salmon often attract other critters such as bald eagles and black bears.</p>
        <p>If you feel adventurous and extend your hike, you may be able to spot the Yuen Ruins which originate from the abandoned Deertail Resort. Once envisioned as a world-class resort with over 200 rooms, spa, and shopping outlets, the resort now lays in ruin along the banks of the Sooke River. The Timber Lodge portion of the property was planned to house Canada's largest log-burning fireplace. The ruins are outside of the park jurisdiction but are a pleasure to view from a distance. Access to the ruins is prohibited, however nice views can be seen from many sections of the trail network.</p>
        <p>Sooke is bear country. Always pack the 11 essentials for hiking when venturing into the wilderness and make sure to secure all attractants such as food.</p>
        <p>Pay parking is in effect May 1 through September 30th.</p>
