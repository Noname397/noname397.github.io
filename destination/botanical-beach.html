            <p>Two hours from Victoria, but well worth the drive, lies Botanical Beach; part of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail and the corresponding Juan de Fuca Provincial Park. Best known for the abundance of life that lives within its sandstone tide pools and rock formations, Botanical Beach provides a habitat for hundreds of species of plants and animals.</p>
        <p>Botanical Beach is a great spot for hiking, picnicking, and beach exploration. The beach represents both a start and end point for the famed Juan de Fuca Marine Trail, a popular multiday hiking route. The park provides a great opportunity for viewing killer whales, gray whales, and harbour seals. Keep your eyes peeled in the tidal pools for chitons, seastars, anemones, urchins, and if you're very lucky, octopus.</p>
        <p>Botanical Beach is located in a wilderness area. Bear and cougar sightings are not uncommon in the park. Always pack the 11 essentials for hiking, and ensure all attractants, such as food, are secured. Tidal changes can result in rapid changes in the landscape, which can cut off certain areas of the park from access. Know the tide before you explore. The rock surface can be extremely slippery, ensure you wear appropriate footwear for this expedition.</p>
